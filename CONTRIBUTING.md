# Contributing TO Letterpad

**First**: if you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

When contributing to Letterpad, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before making a change.

Please follow the below code of conduct in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from master.
2.  Run yarn in the repository root.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes (yarn test).
4.  Format your code with prettier.
5.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
    build.
6.  Update the README.md with details of changes that are useful for a new user.
7.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
    Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
8.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developers, or if you
    do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
